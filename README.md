# Project-1 

Explanations of the technologies used:
Collision Detection- if the top or left of the box goes above a specific px, then it will alert you lose/win depending on the position of the box. I found the (almost) exact px by doing a console log of each movement the box makes, then I would take the px from either the top or left of my box and write a function if it is greater than or less than a specif number (Q me helped me with this). I created the "path" of my game with divs and set the body background color to black and my div background colors to white. 


Approach taken
I started by making my game a huge grid with a bunch of different divs as the cubes. I originally planned to set an alert if my box moved into a specific div to alert you win or lose instead of collision detection. However, this didn't work out as I planned and I had to change my whole game (by a request from the people upstairs). I then worked on the layout of level 1, once I figured that out I had to see what px's were the border of my path, once I figured that out I had to write collision functions with that number. Once I got level one down, it was easy to replicate it and alter it for my other levels. 

User stories
-Start on the home page
    -read directions then press 'start'
-level 1
    -move the cube with the control pad to the green platform 
    -if they hit a wall, click 'ok' and refresh the page
    -if they hit the green platform click 'ok' and then click 'next level'
    (repeat ^ for levels 2, 3, and 4)


Wireframes
(I have pictures of these on my computer, I can email them to you)


How-to-use instructions
Instructions are on the first page of my game, very simple, just use the control pad to move the blue cube to the green platform without hitting a wall. 


Unsolved problems
-going directly to the next level once you hit the green platform
-creating more levels
-removing the two white dashes on the left of the screen (didn't want to try moving this because I was scared it would mess up my pixels)
